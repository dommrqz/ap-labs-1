lab0.2

Description: 
My own implementation of getting the length of a string, appending two strings, and checking if a string is a substring of another string.

Compilation:
I've included a Makefile that compiles and links both files. In order to compile, run make and then run ./str-final, passing as parameters two strings you want to append and a third string to check if string 3 is a substring of the string resulting from appending string 1 and string 2.
