Description:

The code works with recursion, using pythons substringing capabilities to call the same method each time but excluding the first element.

Compilation/Execution:

python3 chal1.py



The part below is from when I tried to solve this using C, but couldnt due to weird memory problems and that working with strings in C is hell.

Description:

The code works via a system of flags, checking if a previous letter was found.

Compilation:

gcc chal1.c -o chal1

Execution:

./chal1
